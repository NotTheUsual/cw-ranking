# CodeWars Ranking Challenge

Exercise to recreate the early CodeWars ranking system completed in week 4 of Makers Academy. I think it was based on a Code Wars challenge originally, but the idea was to do it in a proper test-driven manner. Essentially, a user can be of rank -8 - -1, then 1 - 8. They gain points based on the difficulty of the problems they answer advance a rank whenever they reach 100 points. The tests actually describe the constraints quite well (and should guarantee that everything works, too...)
